# Machine Learning Project Repository

This repository contains Jupyter Notebook files demonstrating key concepts in machine learning through practical examples. Below is a concise overview of the projects and their objectives.

## Project 1: Wholesale Customer Clustering

**Notebook Name**: `Wholesale Cluster-Students.ipynb`

### Objective:
To perform customer segmentation using clustering techniques based on wholesale customer data. The aim is to identify patterns and group customers with similar purchasing behaviors.

### Key Steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Loaded and cleaned the dataset.
   - Handled missing values and scaled the features for clustering.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualized feature distributions and relationships.
   - Used pair plots and correlation heatmaps for insights.
3. **Clustering Techniques**:
   - Implemented K-Means clustering to group customers.
   - Evaluated the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method.
4. **Results Visualization**:
   - Presented clustering results through scatter plots and centroid visualizations.
   - Analyzed each cluster's characteristics to derive actionable insights.

### Libraries Used:
- `pandas`, `numpy` for data manipulation.
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` for visualization.
- `sklearn` for clustering and evaluation.

## Project 2: Real Estate Price Prediction

**Notebook Name**: `Real Estate-Students.ipynb`

### Objective:
To predict real estate prices based on various features such as location, size, and amenities. This project demonstrates regression techniques for supervised learning.

### Key Steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaned the dataset and handled categorical variables.
   - Performed feature engineering and scaling.
2. **EDA**:
   - Analyzed feature importance and relationships using visualizations.
   - Plotted correlations and feature distributions.
3. **Modeling**:
   - Implemented multiple regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest).
   - Evaluated models using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Performed grid search to optimize model performance.
5. **Results Analysis**:
   - Compared model performances and selected the best one for deployment.

### Libraries Used:
- `pandas`, `numpy` for data preprocessing.
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` for data visualization.
- `sklearn` for model implementation and evaluation.
